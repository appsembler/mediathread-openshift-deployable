        When I click the "View Full Collection" link
        Then I am at the Collection page
        There is a maximized Collection panel
        And there is a closed Asset panel
        
        # View an individual asset
        When I click the "MAAP Award Reception" link
        Then there is a minimized Collection panel
        And there is an open Asset panel
        
        # Verify the asset is really there
        The item header is "MAAP Award Reception"

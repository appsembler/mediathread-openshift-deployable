CLEANUP
----------

1. registration/login.html (needs a link and text blurb)
2. remove fromprod.sh
3. alter /apache/
4. flunc tests rel. bvault
5. bvault lxml crawl
6. settings_shared: SECRET_KEY, WIND stuff, ADMINS,INTERNAL_IPS



StructuredCollaboration Plans
-----------------------------
	ARCHITECTURE
	1. objects are unique to a 'context' (locally shared ancestor)
	2. shallow structure except for recursively-typed ones
	3. setting content_object to a Collaboration 
		a. will parse down for finding descendents
		b. but NOT for access control
		c. works like a symlink

	
	QUERIES (current)
	1. request.course still exists
	2. read permissions for context =course (project,asset)
		Project.objects.get(pk=pk,pk__in= )
	3. user projects,assets,sherds by (course)

	USE CASES (future)
	1. Ordered collections (for individuals)
	2. Shared collections (for student teams)
	3. Transcripts
	4. Attaching objects to assignments, etc.
        5. Publishing (to the world, or wider than course/context)

	CURRENT FILES (to edit)
	projects/views.py

		*get_user_projects()
		*all user Sherds from a course
		*all projects from a course with user as participant

		*all course tags (through sherds)
		 -- ?cache (with update on new tag)

		==hard queries==
		*all user Sherds from a course
		--we should optimize assuming people are generally in

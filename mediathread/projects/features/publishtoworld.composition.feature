    Scenario: publishtoworld.composition.feature 1. Instructor creates public to world composition - verify visibility 
        Using selenium
        Given I am test_instructor in Sample Course
        Given there are no projects
        Given publish to world is enabled
        
        # Create a project from the home page
        Given the home workspace is loaded
            There is a Create button
            When I click the Create button
            Then there is a Create Assignment button
            And there is a Create Composition button
            And there is a Create Discussion button
            
            When I click the Create Composition button        
        
        Given the composition workspace is loaded
            Then I am at the Untitled page
            Then I see "by Instructor One"
            And I see "Private"
        
            # Add a title and some text
            Then I call the Composition "Composition Public: Scenario 1"
            And I write some text for the Composition
            
            # Insert an asset
            Then I insert "MAAP Award Reception" into the text
            
            # Insert an annotation
            Then I insert "Left Corner" into the text
        
            # Save
            When I click the Save button
            Then I see a Save Changes dialog        
            Then I set the project visibility to "Whole World - a public url is provided"
            Then I save the changes
            Then there is a "permalink" link
            And there is a "Published to World" link
        
            Then I remember the "permalink" link
            Then I log out
            Then I navigate to the "permalink" link
        
        # Public Composition elements
        Given the composition workspace is loaded
            There is an open Composition panel
            I see "Instructor One"
            And I see "Composition Public: Scenario 1"
            And there is a "permalink" link
        
            The Composition panel does not have a Revisions button
            And the Composition panel does not have an Edit button
            And the Composition panel does not have a Preview button
            And the Composition panel does not have a Save button
            And the Composition panel does not have a +/- Author button
            
            When I click the "MAAP Award Reception" citation in the Composition panel
            Then the Composition panel media window displays "MAAP Award Reception"
            When I click the "Left Corner" citation in the Composition panel
            Then the Composition panel media window displays "Left Corner"
